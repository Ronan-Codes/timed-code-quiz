## Description

* This "Timed-Code-Quiz" was built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. DOM manipulation was utilized to enhance the functionality of the application. These enhancements include countdown timer, a high score list that can be viewed at the end, and questions that appear after the previous one is answered correctly.
    - The countdown decreases by 5 seconds for every wrong answer.
    - The high score list can be viewed by clicking the High Score button (top left of page)
